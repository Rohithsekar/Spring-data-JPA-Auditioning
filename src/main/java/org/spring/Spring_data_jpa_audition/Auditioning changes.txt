In the context of Spring Data JPA, "auditing" refers to the automatic capturing and management of auditing-related
information for entities. It allows you to track and manage metadata about who created or modified an entity, as well
as when those actions occurred.

The auditing feature in Spring Data JPA is designed to simplify the process of recording such information without
explicitly writing the code for it. It provides hooks/callbacks to capture relevant information, such as creation and
modification timestamps and the user responsible for the change, without requiring manual intervention.

Auditing is beneficial for several reasons:

1. **Historical tracking**: Auditing allows you to maintain a historical record of changes made to entities,
enabling you to analyze and understand the timeline of modifications.

2. **Data integrity and accountability**: By capturing information about who made changes, auditing promotes data
integrity and accountability within your application.

3. **Compliance and auditing requirements**: In certain domains or industries, maintaining an audit trail is a
regulatory or compliance requirement. Spring Data JPA's auditing features help fulfill those obligations without writing boilerplate code.

To enable auditing in Spring Data JPA, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. Annotate your entities with appropriate annotations such as `@EntityListeners` or `@CreatedDate` and
`@LastModifiedDate`.

2. Configure Spring Data JPA to enable auditing by adding the `@EnableJpaAuditing` annotation to your application's
configuration class or XML configuration.

3. Optionally, configure other aspects of auditing, such as the type of auditing mechanism (e.g., storing audit data in
a database table or using a custom auditing provider).

With these steps in place, Spring Data JPA will automatically populate the auditing-related fields in your entities when
certain events occur, such as entity creation or modification.

Overall, auditing in Spring Data JPA simplifies the process of capturing and managing auditing information for your
entities, promoting data integrity, accountability, and compliance.
